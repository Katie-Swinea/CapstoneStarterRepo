# Software

One set of software was created for the jeston nano and the primary processing of the system. Another was created for the adruino to control the mechanical part of
the system. Both of these codes were uploaded to the respective hardware. A copy of the jetson nano code is stored here as well. The adruino code was developed while
the mechanical team refined their system prior to integration. It has been housed on the adruino and is not stored here due to the different development history it
had.
