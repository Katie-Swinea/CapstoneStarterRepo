# Reports

This directory includes the final version of our presentation, poster, project proposal, and conceptual design. For the experimental analysis, which contains the
results of our experimentation, go to the Experimental_Analysis directory. For the detailed design of each subsystem, go to the signoffs directory under
documentation. Lessons learned became a individual presentation and is not documented in the team's collective github.
