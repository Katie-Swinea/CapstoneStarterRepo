# Paper Wad Interceptor

## Executive Summary

It is a common problem that students that are currently in school lack interest in STEM subjects. This is a problem for society as it hinders innovation and
discovery in future generations. It also negatively affects current infrastructure and systems in place. Without students who are interested in these fields
of study and existing structures, failures in infrastructure and government programs could occur. This project aims to spark students interest in STEM
fields and applying the principles to existing infrastructure.

The goal of this project is to replicate a missile defense system to interest children in STEM, specifically the department of defense. This is done be
scaling the original problem down to a smaller area. This scale down is proposed as a paper wad interceptor in a classroom. However, this project is
incredibly ambitious for the time provided to the team. Due to this, the project was then simplified further. Instead of a paper wad that could come from
anywhere in a large classroom, the object being tracked was replaced with a plastic practice golf ball. The golf ball will be coming from a structure with
fifteen possible start point and two variable heights. The narrows down the possible trajectories to 30. The space was also contained to a 64 inch by 78
inch rectangle. This resulted in a project focused on small object tracking with the added challenge of the object's material properties and speed. Since
the project was already being scaled down, the project was also turned into a competition between two teams. 

## Capabilities

In it's current state, the team's project is not capable of powering the devices that will be used. The designs have not yet been completed and the project
has not been built, so all the capabilities are theoritcal and proven through datasheets and analysis. The capabilities of the system will be updated
through the design process and culminate in a final summary for the final design.

## Salient Outcomes

The team has learned about tracking smaller objects through this project. The object's size was not an issue the team anticipated to be such a challenge.
While there are several sensors that are capable of tracking objects, very few can reliably track a small object like a plastic golf ball. This issue was
highlighted even further with the limitation sensors that can detect plastic. Research shows that vision detection is the most reliable and used technology
for small object tracking. This was an outcome the team was not expecting from the project. This difficulty was something the team had to overcome and learn
from to achieve the goal of the project.

## Project Demonstration & Images

This project has not yet been fully designed and built. Once the project has been built and can be properly demonstrated, video demonstartions will be shown
via links. Picures of the project while it is not in use will also be included.

## Repo Organization

The timeline that was used as a template for the team's more detailed timeline and this README are present in main with the following repository.


### Reports

This repository contains the original Project Proposal, the revised Proposal, the Conceptual Design and Planning draft, and the final Conceptual Design and
Planning document. All of these files are included as pdf documents. There are also several markdown files containing instructions for furture documents. 
These include the Lessons Learned and Acquired, Experimentation, Final Presentation, and Poster Documents. Lastly, there is another repository called Poster
Template present.

### Documentation

This repository contains several repositories inside of it. One is 3D models which will include all the final designs for 3D models. Next is Electrical which
contains two repositories called PCB and Schematics. PCB will house all final PCB designs. Schematics will house all final designs for wiring schematics. The
Images repository is used to store the images of the final project. The team has also used this repository to house all images used in documentation. Meeting
Minutes are included in a repository here as well. Signoffs contains the approved final design of each subsystem. 

### Software

This repository contains the necessary software and designed software for the project. The ReadMe in this section has not been changes since the team has
not yet used the repository.
