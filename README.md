# Paper Wad Interceptor - Purple Team

## Executive Summary

It is a common problem that students that are currently in school lack interest in STEM subjects. This is a problem for society as it hinders innovation and
discovery in future generations. It also negatively affects current infrastructure and systems in place. Without students who are interested in these fields
of study and existing structures, failures in infrastructure and government programs could occur. This project aims to spark students interest in STEM
fields and applying the principles to existing infrastructure.

The goal of this project is to replicate a missile defense system to interest children in STEM, specifically the department of defense. This is done be
scaling the original problem down to a smaller area. This scale down is proposed as a paper wad interceptor in a classroom. However, this project is
incredibly ambitious for the time provided to the team. Due to this, the project was then simplified further. Instead of a paper wad that could come from
anywhere in a large classroom, the object being tracked was replaced with a plastic practice golf ball. The golf ball will be coming from a structure with
fifteen possible start point and two variable heights. The narrows down the possible trajectories to 30. The space was also contained to a 64 inch by 78
inch rectangle. This resulted in a project focused on small object tracking with the added challenge of the object's material properties and speed. Since
the project was already being scaled down, the project was also turned into a competition between two teams. 

## Capabilities

This system is able to accurately detect, track, and aim at the incoming golfballs on the gameboard. It has been designed to mitigate false detections as much as possible. It is able to accurately intercept the
ball a significant percent of the time.

## Salient Outcomes

The team has learned about tracking smaller objects through this project. The object's size was not an issue the team anticipated to be such a challenge.
While there are several sensors that are capable of tracking objects, very few can reliably track a small object such as a plastic golf ball. This issue was
highlighted even further with the limitation sensors that can detect plastic. Research shows that vision detection is the most reliable and used technology
for small object tracking. This was an outcome the team was not expecting from the project. This difficulty was something the team had to overcome and learn
from to achieve the goal of the project.

## Project Demonstration & Images

The experimental analysis of this repository has several pictures of the capabilities of this project. The final presentation also has a video of the interceptor tracking and hitting the golfball.

## About Us

### Team

Garrett Armstrong: Electrical Engineering major who focused on the power for the system created.

Savannah Metlzer: Electrical Engineering major who focused on providing the signal conversions and aiming coordinates for the motors.

Jonathan Neal: Electrical Engineering major who focused on interfacing the extra lights and sound into the system.

Finlay Patoto: Computer Engineering major who focused on the processor and basic mathmatical calculations from the sensor data.

Katie Swinea: Computer Engineering major who focused on the computer vision algorithms to detect the object and convey the sensor data.

Kevin Ulrich: Computer Engineering major who focused on the research and calibration of a sensor to detect the object.

### Faculty Supervisor

The team's faculty supervisor was Dr. Jesse Roberts. The team's supervisor then became Micah Rentschler for the second semester.

### Stakeholders

The customer is Devcom who also created and proposed the project and competition.

### Recognitions

The team wants to acknowledge the contributions of the partnered Mechanical Engineering team. The team consists of: Ishak Lamei, Samuel Rainey, Steven
Tucker, and Austin Williams. The team would also like to thank Cooper Nelson for helping the team test different sensor options before ordering, Ethan Dixon who was a source of moral support through out the
project, and Adam Morrow who was on the other team, but helped us finish construction of the gameboard and let us bounce ideas off of him.

## Repo Organization

The timeline that was used as a template for the team's more detailed timeline and this README are present in main with the following repository.


### Reports

This repository contains the original Project Proposal, the revised Proposal, the Conceptual Design and Planning draft, and the final Conceptual Design and
Planning document. All of these files are included as pdf documents. There are also several markdown files containing instructions for furture documents. 
These include the Lessons Learned and Acquired, Experimentation, Final Presentation, and Poster Documents. Lastly, there is another repository called Poster
Template present.

### Documentation

This repository contains several repositories inside of it. One is 3D models which will include all the final designs for 3D models. Next is Electrical which
contains two repositories called PCB and Schematics. PCB will house all final PCB designs. Schematics will house all final designs for wiring schematics. The
Images repository is used to store the images of the final project. The team has also used this repository to house all images used in documentation. Meeting
Minutes are included in a repository here as well. Signoffs contains the approved final design of each subsystem. 

### Software

This repository contains the necessary software and designed software for the project. All of theses softwares are already uploaded to the appropriate hardware.
