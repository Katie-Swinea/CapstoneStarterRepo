Firgure 1 : Device Power Subsystem

The goal of this subsystem is to convert AC power from the wall outlet to DC power, then distribute that power to the different device systems.  

**Constraints:**

| NO. | Constraint                                                          | Origin           |

<sup>1</sup> The power system shall be connected to the emergancy stop [Conceptual Design]

The power system will be connected to the emergancy stop which will act as an extension cord with a turn of switch. This emergancy stop will be directly connected to the wall outlet.

<sup>2</sup> The power system shall power the main/processor unit [Conceptual Design]

The system will need to be the primary power source for the main/processor unit. This system will be responsible for powering or providing the necessary power to every componet in the main unit. 

<sup>3</sup> The power system shall power the communication receiver [Conceptual Design]

The system will need to be the primary power source for the communication unit. This system will be responsible for powering or providing the necessary power to every componet in the communication unit. 

<sup>4</sup> The power system shall power the mechanical unit [Conceptual Design]

The system will need to be the primary power source for the mechanical unit. This system will be responsible for powering or providing the necessary power to every componet in the mechanical unit. 

<sup>5</sup> The system shall convert AC power to DC power [Conceptual Design]

This system will take the AC power supplied from the wall outlet and then convert that to a DC signal that will be provided to the other subsystems.
