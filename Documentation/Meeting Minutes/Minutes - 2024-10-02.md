# Capstone II Team 5 Week 5 (10/30 – 10/04)

### 10/02 @ 11:00 AM – 11:32 AM

### Attendance: Everyone + Mechanicals

## Updates:

Garrett: Mapped out subsystems within 1 cubic foot box.

Finn: Researched communication protocols for link between Jetson and arduino

Katie: Determined method for testing timing and gathering frame data.

Ross: Mapped out subsystems within 1 cubic foot box.

Savannah: Helped mechanicals swap from their arduino to our arduino

Kevin: Helped map out subsystems within 1 cubic foot box.

## Future Tasks:

Garrett: Continue mapping out subsystems in box. Ordered new parts for mechanical subsystem change.

Finn: Implement communication with arduinos.

Katie: Implement multi-frame data storing. Start testing actual timing processes.

Ross: Continue mapping out subsystems in box.

Savannah: Help implement communication with Jetson.

Kevin: Submit BOM for new, longer usb c cable.

## Discussions/Decisions:

Discussed housing layouts for fitting each subsystem into required space.
