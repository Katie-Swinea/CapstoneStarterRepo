## Meeting Minutes

Each meeting had minutes taken to document the team's progress and discussions. There was at least one meeting a week aside from weeks such as spring break.
For these weeks, a document was uploaded indicating the reason for a lack of meetings that week.

- The file is titled "Minutes - YYYY-MM-DD" in the readable format of either a pdf or md file.
- All meeting discussions are briefly summarized in the minutes
- All decisions, tasks, and progress are documented in the meeting minutes.
