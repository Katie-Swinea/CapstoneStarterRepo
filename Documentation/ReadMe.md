## Final set of prints (final design artifacts)

The proper file type of any buildable designs are given in the proper file format.

### 3D Models

Required format: 
- .stl

The 3D models will be used to showcase the final build of the project.


### Wiring Schematics

Required software: 
- autocad or autocad electrical
